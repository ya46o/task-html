            A circle is a closed geometric shape where all points are equidistant from a central point called the center. The distance from the center to any point on the circle is the radius, and the diameter, which passes through the center, is twice the radius. The circumference is the distance around the circle, calculated using the formula 
            𝐶=2𝜋𝑟 C=2πr, while the area is determined by 𝐴=𝜋𝑟2 A=πr 2.
            A chord is a line segment connecting two points on the circle, and an arc represents a portion of the circle’s edge between two points. A sector is a wedge-shaped part of a circle defined by two radii and the arc between them. Circles have both rotational symmetry and infinite lines of symmetry, making them unique in geometry.
