    <p><b style="background-color: pink;"><u>Lord Shiva,</u></b> also known as Mahadeva, is one of the principal deities in Hinduism, revered as the Supreme Being who embodies the cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction. Often depicted with a third eye on his forehead, a crescent moon adorning his head, and a serpent coiled around his neck, Shiva symbolizes wisdom, power, and the interconnectedness of all life. He is both ascetic and householder, meditating in serene isolation on Mount Kailash while also being a loving father to Ganesha and Kartikeya. His dance, the Tandava, represents the cosmic rhythm of life and the inevitable process of renewal through destruction.</p>
